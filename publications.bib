  abstract = {We have developed a highly scalable application, called Shoal, for
              tracking and utilizing a distributed set of HTTP web caches. Our
              application uses the Squid HTTP cache. Squid servers advertise
              their existence to the Shoal server via AMQP messaging by running
              Shoal Agent. The Shoal server provides a simple REST interface
              that allows clients to determine their closest Squid cache. Our
              goal is to dynamically instantiate Squid caches on IaaS clouds in
              response to client demand. Shoal provides the VMs on IaaS clouds
              with the location of the nearest dynamically instantiated Squid
              Cache.}
